My name is Ayushi Saxena. I am a software engineer and GenAI expert. I'm from Delhi, currently working in Sonipat, Haryana.
I know about transformer architecture, LLMs, RAG, Langchain and Vector Databases. I am looking for opportunities in GenAI Engineering Roles. 
I love online gaming. Currently I'm playing Brawl Stars but I also like strategic games like Sid Mier's Civilization series.
