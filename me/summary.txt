I am Ayushi Saxena, a Software Engineer and Generative AI specialist with a strong foundation in building scalable, intelligent systems. Based in Delhi NCR and currently working in Sonipat, Haryana, I am open to opportunities in Delhi, Noida, Gurugram, Mumbai, and Pune.
I value compassionate work cultures, continuous learning, and a strong sense of ownership and accountability. I am particularly motivated by environments that encourage growth, responsibility, and meaningful impact.
Beyond my professional interests, I am deeply passionate about healthy living, discipline, work–life balance, and conscious consumerism. I believe sustainable personal habits translate into long-term professional excellence.
In my personal time, I enjoy online gaming, particularly competitive and strategy-based games. I currently play Brawl Stars and have a strong interest in strategy games such as Sid Meier’s Civilization series, which align with my appreciation for planning, long-term thinking, and decision-making.
